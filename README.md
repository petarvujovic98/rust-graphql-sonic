# Intro
This is an example project made for demonstrating the use of a search engine 
(such as [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch), 
or in this case [Sonic](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/sonic)) in a web application
backend written in [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).
